1. Current Stage & Immediate Next Step:

    We have a model training on single frames, conditioned by segment-level audio, with initial cross-attention. Results are mixed.
    Next: Implement Systematic Qualitative Evaluation (as discussed) by logging generated MRI frames for fixed audio inputs at epoch ends. This helps us better track improvements in visual quality and audio-visual correspondence.

2. Iterative Refinement of the Current Frame-Level Model:

    Enhance Audio Representation: Based on the systematic evaluation, if audio influence is still weak, we'll focus on improving the SimpleAudioEncoder (e.g., increase its capacity, try a slightly more complex architecture like adding an RNN layer) or consider using a sequence of audio tokens from it.
    Tune U-Net & Attention: Adjust attention_resolutions, number of heads, or U-Net capacity if needed.
    (Repeat systematic qualitative evaluation after significant changes to assess impact.)

3. Transition to Video Segment Processing (Temporal Modeling):

    Short Sequence Processing: Modify the U-Net to accept a short sequence of frames (e.g., 3-5 frames) from your video segments as input instead of a single frame.
    This will involve changing the U-Net's input layer and potentially adding components like 3D convolutional layers (used sparingly to manage complexity) or temporal attention layers that operate across the input frames.
    The audio conditioning (from the corresponding full audio segment) will still apply to this sequence.
    Adapt Training & Sampling: The data loading, forward diffusion process, and sampling loop will be updated to handle these short sequences.

4. Refining Video Denoising and Consistency:

    Longer-Term Temporal Consistency: If processing is still window-based (e.g., short sequences), explore strategies to ensure smooth transitions and consistency if you were to denoise an entire long video segment by processing it in overlapping windows.
    Evaluate Video Quality: Assess the "denoising" quality on video sequences.

5. Addressing Inference Scenarios (Flexibility):

    Inference Without Audio: To achieve your goal of denoising MRI videos even if audio is unavailable at inference time (after the model has been trained with audio), we'll need a strategy. This could involve:
    Training the model with a certain percentage of "null" or masked audio embeddings, so it learns to rely less on audio when it's not informative or present.
    Using a generic or learned "unconditional" embedding if audio is missing at inference.
    The aim here is for the audio to enhance denoising when available, but for the model to still perform competently as a visual denoiser if audio is absent.

6. Further Evaluation and Fine-Tuning:

    Explore any applicable no-reference quantitative metrics for video quality or denoising.
    Continue hyperparameter tuning and architectural refinements based on results with video segment processing.
