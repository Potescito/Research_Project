Should We Change the U‑Net Approach to Other/Better Architectures?
The U‑Net architecture is a strong baseline for image and video restoration due to its multi-scale, skip-connection design. However, there are alternatives that might further improve performance, such as:

Transformer-based or Hybrid Models: These can capture global context better (e.g., hierarchical transformers, VideoMAE-style architectures).

Diffusion Models: They have shown impressive results in image and video restoration, though they can be more computationally intensive and require iterative refinement.

Cascaded or Dual-stage Networks: A two-stage approach where an initial model denoises the video and a second network refines the output can sometimes lead to better results.
The decision to switch architectures depends on factors like the complexity of your data, computational constraints, and the improvements seen with the current U‑Net. If your U‑Net is underperforming despite careful tuning, exploring transformer-based approaches or cascaded models could be worthwhile.

Implementing a Training Schema with Contrastive Losses:
Contrastive learning has proven powerful in self-supervised settings by encouraging the model to distinguish between similar and dissimilar pairs. In the context of video denoising without clean ground truths, you might:

Use temporal contrastive losses that force representations of adjacent (or corresponding) windows to be similar while pushing apart representations of different segments.

Leverage multiview contrastive losses where the model is encouraged to produce similar features for different augmentations or views (e.g., different sliding windows) of the same underlying content.
These losses could be added to the composite loss function to enhance feature alignment and robustness. However, their benefit is empirical—you’d need to experiment with weightings and sampling strategies.

Using an Approach Similar to VideoMAE:
VideoMAE (Masked Autoencoders for Video) has demonstrated that a masked reconstruction task can help learn strong video representations. Adapting a similar strategy for denoising can be promising:

You could pretrain a model with a VideoMAE-like objective (masking parts of the video and learning to reconstruct them) and then fine-tune on your denoising task.

Alternatively, you could incorporate a masking strategy within your current framework to encourage the model to learn robust representations. The challenge is integrating audio: you’d have to design a multi-modal masked reconstruction objective that jointly masks parts of the video (and possibly audio) and uses the unmasked information for reconstruction. It’s promising but adds complexity compared to the hybrid attention mechanism.

Pretraining with a Model like VideoMAE:
Pretraining can provide a significant boost, especially when you don’t have clean ground truths. Using a VideoMAE-style pretraining on a large collection of video data (ideally from a similar domain) can:

Provide strong initial representations that are robust and generalizable.

Reduce the amount of supervised (or self-supervised fine-tuning) data required for good performance on your denoising task. However, if your MR image videos are very different from natural videos, you might need domain-specific pretraining data. Pretraining on ImageNet or generic videos may help the lower-level features, but fine-tuning or additional pretraining on domain-specific data could be crucial.
